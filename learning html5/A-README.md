When working with HTML, you should follow these guidelines:

1. Use Proper Document Structure: Start with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and follow the HTML5 structure with `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

2. Semantic Markup: Use appropriate HTML tags (like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`) to give meaning to the content and improve accessibility.

3. Valid HTML: Ensure your HTML code adheres to W3C standards by validating it using tools like the W3C Markup Validation Service.

4. Indentation and Formatting: Maintain consistent indentation and use proper formatting to improve code readability.

5. Separate Structure from Presentation: Use CSS for styling instead of inline styles to separate structure and design.

6. Use Meaningful IDs and Classes: Choose descriptive names for IDs and classes to make your code easier to understand and maintain.

7. Accessibility: Ensure your HTML is accessible by using appropriate alt attributes for images, semantic elements, and following accessibility guidelines like ARIA roles.

8. Comments: Add comments to your code to explain complex sections or to provide context for others who might work with your code.

9. Consistency: Maintain consistent naming conventions, indentation, and coding practices throughout your HTML documents.

10. Cross-Browser Compatibility: Test your HTML code on different browsers to ensure consistent rendering and functionality.

11. Avoid Deprecated Tags: Use modern HTML tags and avoid deprecated ones like `<center>`, `<font>`, etc.

12. Mobile Responsiveness: Design your HTML with mobile devices in mind, ensuring that your content displays well on different screen sizes.

13. External Resources: Link to external CSS and JavaScript files rather than embedding them directly in your HTML.

14. Minimize Use of Tables: Tables should primarily be used for tabular data, not for layout purposes. Use CSS for layout design.

15. Use Alt Text for Images: Provide descriptive alt text for images to improve accessibility and SEO.

Remember that these guidelines are just a starting point. Keep up with best practices and web standards as they evolve.
